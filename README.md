# Overview

The platformers (Hanzo's mind palace) premise explores escapings one's inner self while confronting setbacks that challanges your ideals and decisions. This creates the symbolic journey of emotional and mental resilience that represents the psychology of every human being. At the centre of my game is a unfortunate victim that was trapped in a hostile environment by their inner self, this shows the doubts clouding the protagonists mind and is engaging in a internal conflict with himself. Their struggles becoming the landscape of the game, and each platform is a symbol for an obstacle that they must overcome.

The intricate tunnel system at the very start represents the facade the he was putting on the the lights represents what he was revealing to the world.

The chasm represents the differences between his inner self that had been hiding and the current facade he was putting for show, and the platforms allowing for the possibilities of him embracing his inner self and the end should resonate with the player, showing while the journey was difficult, the victim had emerged more resilient than his past and had accepted himself for who he was. This conclusion shows the human reslience when it came to facing obstacles and how they overcame their struggles through sheer will. By merging psychological symbolism with platforming mechanics, your game can offer a unique experience that explores meaning into the challenges not only put to a player's skills but also to his or her understanding of resilience and self-discovery.
