# Overview

The platformers (Hanzo's mind palace) premise explores escapings one's inner self while confronting setbacks that challanges your ideals and decisions. This creates the symbolic journey of emotional and mental resilience that represents the psychology of every human being. At the centre of my game is a unfortunate victim that was trapped in a hostile environment by their inner self, this shows the doubts clouding the protagonists mind and is engaging in a internal conflict with himself. Their struggles becoming the landscape of the game, and each platform is a symbol for an obstacle that they must overcome.

The intricate tunnel system at the very start represents the facade the he was putting on the the lights represents what he was revealing to the world.

The chasm represents the differences between his inner self that had been hiding and the current facade he was putting for show, and the platforms allowing for the possibilities of him embracing his inner self and the end should resonate with the player, showing while the journey was difficult, the victim had emerged more resilient than his past and had accepted himself for who he was. This conclusion shows the human reslience when it came to facing obstacles and how they overcame their struggles through sheer will. By merging psychological symbolism with platforming mechanics, your game can offer a unique experience that explores meaning into the challenges not only put to a player's skills but also to his or her understanding of resilience and self-discovery.

# Documentation

The orginal plan being a 2D souls like game, where the player is tasked with killing hordes of enemies and bosses which represents their past trauma's. The assets my multimedia partner created is a multitude of attack animations and enemy creatures, firstly I started with the player controls, where I then tweaked the script to include a dashing ability. Around this time I tried to implement the ability to wall jump where it worked but there was an error with my wall slide script that I coudn't find a solution for so I had to scrap the ability for wall sliding. Then my next project was to include permeable platforms into my game for a more immersive gameplay, such as one way floors (Up or down) and two way floors where I combined the two different skills on a single platform.

(This was the code for the permeable platforms)

For the asset I implemented a walking/idle animation but he couldn't make a jumping animation as he didn't have enough time and my cursor which was an asset I had borrowed off the internet. The tiles and lanterns were assets borrowed from unity asset store as I realised that I didn't have the ability to implement the complex attack animation that my partner created so I switched plans and created a platformer instead. To increase the difficulty of my game I added a water obstacle that resets your position the moment you touch the object.

I added more customisations to my game such as an interactive scroll wheel the enlarges the camera or zooms for a better view of the game and also implemented the ability for the camera to follow the player around so the player wouldn't lose their sight on their character.

During the progress of improving my game I had learnt a lot from watching the tutorials such as the fundamental basics of game development, such as creating a structured 2D platformer with engaging background environment and simple movement controls for a platformer on unity. I also learnt the ability to create simple sprites such as the game icon and the trapdoor used in the platformer, this enhanced my understanding of multiumedia and finding out my prefered art style that works with my designs which indirectly improved my skills in pixel art. Debugging the game was a huge hassel as it took many trials and errors to really understand the code that I was implementing into my game, this made me able to smoothen out my already vibrant game as it improved my problem solving abilities.
